\section{Majority Voting (Triple Modular Redundancy)}
You receive the following bits $M=010011111100$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What was the original message $X$?
    \item How many errors occured in the received message?
\end{itemize} 

\section{Parity}
What is the parity bit for the message $X=0101110100100110$ if even parity is used?

\section{Hamming(7,4)}


You want to send the message $X=1110$ using hamming code (7,4) in the usual format $M=d_3d_2d_1p_2d_0p_1p_0$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the logic values of the parity bits $p_0$, $p_1$ and $p_2$?
    \item What is the fully encoded message $M$?
\end{itemize}


\noindent You receive the encoded message $M=0011101$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Did an error occur and if so on which position of the received message?
    \item What was the original message $X$?
\end{itemize}

\noindent You receive the encoded message $M=0011110$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Did an error occur and if so on which position of the received message?
    \item What was the original message $X$?
\end{itemize}


\noindent You receive the encoded message $M=1000100$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Did an error occur and if so on which position of the received message?
    \item What was the original message $X$?
\end{itemize}

\section{Hamming(7,4) SEC-DED}

You want to send the message $X=0101$ using hamming code (7,4) with an additional parity bit $p_3$ using the format $M=p_3d_3d_2d_1p_2d_0p_1p_0$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What are the logic values of the three usual parity bits $p_0$, $p_1$ and $p_0$?
    \item What is the value of the additional parity bit $p_3$?
    \item What is the whole encoded message $M$?
\end{itemize}

\noindent You receive the encoded message $M=01100110$.
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the overall parity of the message?
    \item Is the even parity property still valid in all three groups of the hamming code?
    \item Using the combined information, was there no, one or two errors in the received message?
    \item Are you able to obtain the original message $X$?
\end{itemize}

\section{Does order matter?}
You are sending a $n$-bit encoded message with error correction over a parallel $n$-bit noisy channel. 
Does the order in which you arrange the data and ECC bits matter?

You are now instead serializing the encoded message, sending one bit at a time over $n$ cycles. 
Does the order in which the bits are sent matter?

You are now storing the encoded data into a memory module. Does the order of the data and ECC bits matter now?
